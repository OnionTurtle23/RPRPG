5/12/25 - Just over a week into the project, grinding super slowly now. Spending a lot of time trying to figure out blender, trying to figure out how to make assets for the game. Art is not my art. Sarcasm is. . . .Turns out, you can't 'retort' your computer into making cool stuff. Up to this point I have been learning some things about JSON and making systems for equipment, enemies, characters, party, and I'm starting on the tech(special abilities) system. Didn't code for a couple days while I've been trying to figure out some assets. I was pretty sure I wanted to use pygame but since blender works with python, I'm leaning that direction if I can. Pretty proud of the quadratic I used to calculate experience points, and the negative logarithms I used to for skill point curves. Sharp rise in the beginning, tapering down to a low gain as levels get higher. Seems realistic to me, progress comes quick when you start, over time you progress less quickly and the progress isn't as dramatic. Trying to add one of these log entries when I push to git, which I am trying to do daily

# RPRPG
first attempt at making a game, I've never been more certain about anything in my life that I am not doing any of this right. But I am learning a lot!
The game is heavily inspired by my favorites like FFVII and takes inspiration form post-apocalyptic stories like Fallout (mostly the old ones). But the story is my own.
As of the beginning of this I am a second-year CS student with little experience and I chose python becasue its all I know at this point.
I am open to advice and constructive criticism, the more the merrier. I will add to this as features become avaialble.
